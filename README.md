**What is _desCharts_?**  
Yet another android charting library.

**Why the name _desCharts_?**  
A tribute to [René Descartes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes), father of analytical geometry.

**Credits**  
I learned how to create a custom chart view studying Daniel Nadeau's [HoloGraphLibrary](https://bitbucket.org/danielnadeau/holographlibrary), a wonderful android charting library, then I decided to write a library from scratch... just for fun. :)
